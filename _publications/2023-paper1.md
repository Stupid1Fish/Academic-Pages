excerpt: 'Background: The early craniofacial development is a highly coordinated process involving neural crest cell migration, proliferation, epithelial apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Both genetic defects and environmental factors can affect these processes and result in orofacial clefts. Mutations in MID1 gene cause X-linked Opitz Syndrome (OS), which is a congenital malformation characterized by craniofacial defects including cleft lip/palate (CLP). Previous studies demonstrated impaired neurological structure and function in Mid1 knockout mice, while no CLP was observed. However, given the highly variable severities of the facial manifestations observed in OS patients within the same family carrying identical genetic defects, subtle craniofacial malformations in Mid1 knockout mice could be overlooked in these studies. Therefore, we propose that a detailed morphometric analysis should be necessary to reveal mild craniofacial dysmorphologies that reflect the similar developmental defects seen in OS patients.\n

Results: In this research, morphometric study of the P0 male Mid1-cKO mice were performed using Procrustes superimposition as well as EMDA analysis of the size-adjusted three-dimensional coordinates of 105 skull landmarks, which were collected on the bone surface reconstructed using microcomputed tomographic images. Our results revealed the craniofacial deformation such as the increased dimension of the frontal and nasal bone in Mid1-cKO mice, in line with the most prominent facial features such as hypertelorism, prominent forehead, broad and/or high nasal bridge seen in OS patients.\n

Conclusion: While been extensively used in evolutionary biology and anthropology in the last decades, geometric morphometric analysis was much less used in developmental biology. Given the high interspecies variances in facial anatomy, the work presented in this research suggested the advantages of morphometric analysis in characterizing animal models of craniofacial developmental defects to reveal phenotypic variations and the underlining pathogenesis.\n
