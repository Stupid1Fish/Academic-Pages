excerpt: '
**Research question:** If the constructed MID1 gene conditional knockout mouse model does not exhibit the highly variable clinical features seen in OS patients, does this mouse model still hold research value in studying the pathological mechanisms and potential treatments of OS?<br><br>

**Results:** In this research, morphometric study of the P0 male <i>Mid1</i>-cKO mice were performed using Procrustes superimposition as well as EMDA analysis of the size-adjusted three-dimensional coordinates of 105 skull landmarks, which were collected on the bone surface reconstructed using microcomputed tomographic images. Our results revealed the craniofacial deformation such as the increased dimension of the frontal and nasal bone in <i>Mid1</i>-cKO mice, in line with the most prominent facial features such as hypertelorism, prominent forehead, broad and/or high nasal bridge seen in Opitz Syndrome (OS) patients.<br><br>

**Conclusion:** While been extensively used in evolutionary biology and anthropology in the last decades, geometric morphometric analysis was much less used in developmental biology. Given the high interspecies variances in facial anatomy, the work presented in this research suggested the advantages of morphometric analysis in characterizing animal models of craniofacial developmental defects to reveal phenotypic variations and the underlining pathogenesis.<br>'
