**Research question:** If the constructed <i>Mid1</i> gene conditional knockout(<i>Mid1</i>-cKO) mouse model does not exhibit the highly variable clinical features seen in Opitz Syndrome (OS) patients, does this mouse model still hold research value in studying the pathological mechanisms and potential treatments of OS?

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fig. 1.</span> Generation of Mid1 conditional knockout in NCCs. 
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A.</span> Schematic diagram of the construction of the _Mid1_-floxed allele for generating the conditional knockout of _Mid1_ in the NCCs. Exon 5 of _Mid1_ was flanked by loxP sites. The FRT flanked Neo cassette was deleted by crossing chimeras with FLP females generated the _Mid1_-floxed F1 heterozygotes (_Mid1_<sup>flox/+</sup>sup>), which were subsequently crossed with Wnt1-Cre transgenic mice to generate _Mid1_-cKO male mice (_Mid1_<sup>flox/y</sup>sup>; _Wnt1_-Cre). The position and direction of primers used for genotyping were indicated with black arrows. 
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">B.</span> The body weight (left) and body length (right) have been monitored weekly in _Mid1_<sup>+/y</sup>sup>, _Mid1_<sup>flox/y</sup>, and _Mid1_<sup>flox/y</sup>; _Wnt1_-Cre mice.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">C.</span> PCR genotyping. Fragments of IL3 (544 bp) and Sry (402 bp, male-specific) were amplified for determination the gender of the mice. A 350 bp Cre replicon was amplified from the expression cassette of the Cre recombinase. Allele-specific PCR amplified 499 bp wild-type and 557 bp loxP fragments at the 5’ end loxP site to identify the F1 heterozygous. Allele-specific PCR amplified 344 bp wide-type and 466 bp loxP amplicons at the 3’ end loxP site to determine the heterozygosity at this locus. 
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">D.</span> PCR testing for identifying the deletion of Mid1 exon 5. A 1721 bp wild-type and a 511 bp knockout fragments were amplified using genomic DNA of _Mid1_-cKO mice.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">E.</span> RT-PCR using the cDNA of a _Mid1_-cKO male mice, showing a 173 bp amplicon of the transcript from Mid1 mutant allele in target tissue and a 310 bp amplicon of the transcript from intact _Mid1_ allele.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">F.</span> Western blot detected a 75-kDa MID1 protein in wild-type male mice and a reduced expression in Mid1-cKO male mice. Protein levels were normalized with respect to the level of β-actin expression.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">G.</span> Immunofluorescence of transverse sections of neural tubes (nb) of E10.5 embryo showed the ablation of Mid1 expression in the neural crest cells of Mid1-cKO mice. The migrating NCCs were identified with anti-Sox9 (green) and the expression of Mid1 was identified with anti-MID1 (red).

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fig. 2</span> Wild-type and Mid1-cKO mouse skulls stained for cartilage and bone. The skulls of the P0 mice were stained with Alcian blue (cartilage) and Alizarin red (mineralization) after micro-CT scan, photographed from lateral (A and D), top (B and E), and ventral view (C and F). Hypo-ossification was noticed in the frontal bone close to the sagittal suture, indicated with black arrows (E).

**Conclusion:** In <i>Mid1</i>-cKO mice, subtle craniofacial malformations resemble the developmental defects observed in patients with X-linked OS.
<br>

**Deficiencies and improvements:**
<br>
1、本文所呈现的颌面差异分析针对的是整体，确实应该对PC1进行更为深入的研究
2、更多可视化的方式未能呈现，如颅骨骨密度热图等
3、MID1的功能及其导致颌面发育扰动的机制尚未能深入研究
3、MID2的研究未有涉及
