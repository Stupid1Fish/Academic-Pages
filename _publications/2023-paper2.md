excerpt: '
**Research question:** If the constructed <i>mid1</i> gene conditional knockout mouse model does not exhibit the highly variable clinical features seen in Opitz Syndrome (OS) patients, does this mouse model still hold research value in studying the pathological mechanisms and potential treatments of OS?<br><br>

**Conclusion:** In <i>Mid1</i> knockout mice, there are subtle craniofacial malformations that resemble the developmental defects observed in patients with X-linked OS.<br>'
