<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A.</span> The body weights of the mice were recorded before and after the stereotactic injection just before the sacrifice. Long-term (2 months) overexpression of miR-203 in the hippocampus did not result in noticeable change in the general health in the infected mice (n = 7). The mice infected with the control vector GV309-Scr-eGFP in the hippocampus were used as control (n = 12).<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">B.</span> The spatial-type and recognitive aspect of memory was estimated in the Y maze test. The spontaneous alternations revealed no significant differences in the GV309-pre-miR-203-eGFP infected mice, comparing with the control mice infected with GV309-Scr-eGFP.<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">C.</span> The spatial learning and memories were judged by MWM test. The representative swim paths on the first day and on the day of the probe trail of MWM test were presented.<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">D.</span> A similar pattern of increased escape latency between the mice overexpressing miR-203 and the control mice was observed during the four-day consecutive training.<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">E and F.</span> The number of crossing and the traveling distance in the probe trail displayed no significant difference between the mice overexpressing miR-203 and the control mice.<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">G–I.</span> Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the open field test. The time spend in the central zone was presented in the averaged hot map (G). The distance traveled (H) and the moving speed (I) revealed no difference between the mice overexpressing miR-203 and the control mice.<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">J–L.</span> Consistent with the results in the behavioral assessment, the representative electron micrographs showed that neither the synaptic structure (J and K) nor the number of synapse (J) has significant differences between miR-203 overexpressing mice and the control. Scale bar, 500 nm.<br> 
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">M.</span> No significant neuron loss was observed in the hippocampus of miR-203 overexpressing mice using Nissl staining. Mice with the infection of GV309-Scr-eGFP in the hippocampus were used as the controls. Scale bar, 30 μm.

**Conclusion:** AFF4 has been identified as a new target protein of miR-203 in the CNS.
<br>

**Deficiencies and improvements:** In vivo experiments of miR-203 overexpression did not reveal a significant influence, and the complex regulatory mechanisms of miR-203 remain unclear.
