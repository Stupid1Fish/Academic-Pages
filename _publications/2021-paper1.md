**Result1:** miR-203 target gene prediction
<br>
**Result2:** Verification of AFF4 as a potential target of miR-203
<br>
**Result3:** AFF4 is a bona fida protein target of miR-203 in vivo
<br>
**Result4:** Overexpression of miR-203 in the mouse hippocampus displayed nonoticeable disturbance of CNS function
