Fig. 2. miR-203 targeted AFF4 mRNA 3′UTR and down-regulated its expression.<br>
A and B. Western blotan alysis of AFF4(A) or 14-3-3θ(B) in untransfected 293Tcells and cells transfected with miR-203 mimics or scramble miRNA.<br>
C and D. There lative expression of AFF4(C) or 14-3-3θ(D) was measured by densitometry and normalized to that of untransfected cells and quantified using ImageJ.<br>
E.These quence of the 371bp 3′UTR containing the two miR-203:AFF4 interaction sites was cloned in top miRGLO.<br>
F.The diagram illustrates these quences of wild type and the sense mutation of the miR-203 binding sites.<br> 
G.Luciferase assay showed a direct in hibitory effect of miR-203on AFF4 mRNA 3′UTR. Luciferase reporter construct containing the human wild type AFF4 mRNA 3′UTR or AFF4 mRNA 3′UTR with sense mutantion in the two miR-203 binding sites was co-transfected with miR-203 mimics or inhibitor in to 293T cells. Luminescence for luciferase gene activity was obtained 48h post-transfection.There lative luciferase activity was normalized to respective negative controls.Data are presented as mean±SD, from 3  independent experiments. Statistical significance was tested using the Student's t-test and P-value (*, P<0.05, n=3 vs. control).

Fig. 3. miR-203 down-regulate the expression of AFF4 in vivo.<br> 
A and B. Western blot analysis demonstrated that AFF4 was ubiquitously expressed in CNS (A), with relatively high expression in the hypothalamus (B).<br> 
C. A schematic diagram showing the construction of a lentiviral vector containing GFP expression cassette and the 76 bp fragment of pre-miR-203.<br>
D. The viral titer was monitored and the overexpression of miR-203 was verified using real-time RT-PCR in GV309-pre-miR-203-eGFP infected 293T cells (n=3, P<0.0001), Scale bar, 200μm.<br>
E.As chematic diagram showing the stereotactic injection of the lentiviral vectors in to the mouse hippocampus CA1 subregion and the representative image of the expression of GV309-pre-miR-203-eGFP in mouse CA1. Scalebar,1000μm. <br>
F.The overexpression of miR-203 in the GV309-pre-miR-203-eGFP infected hippocampus was verified using real-time RT-PCR (n=3, P<0.05).<br>
G and I.The representative figures of western blotting confirmed the down-regulated expression of AFF4 in the hippocampus overexpressing miR-203 (n=3, P<0.05).<br> 
H and J. 14-3-3θ was used as a positive control, which expression was also downregulated in the hippocampus overexpressing miR-203 (n=3, P<0.05).
