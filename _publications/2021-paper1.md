Fig. 1. The predicted miR-203:AFF4 interaction. 
A. Venn diagram showing that together 27 proteins were predicted harboring the miR-203 recognition sites by all four algorisms of TargetScan, miRDB, Tarbase and MicroT-CTD. 
B. The two predicted miRNA:mRNA interaction sites in the 3′UTR of AFF4. 
C. The sequences of miR-203 and the miR-203:AFF4 interaction are conserved in human and mouse.
